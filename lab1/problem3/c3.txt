A laboratory has several chemists who work on one or more projects. Chemists
also may use certain types of equipment on each project. Attributes of chemists
include employee id, name and phone number. The lab also wants to keep track of
project id and start date, and equipment serial number and cost. The organization
wishes to keep track of the date a specific piece of equipment was assigned to a
specific chemist to work on a specific project.
