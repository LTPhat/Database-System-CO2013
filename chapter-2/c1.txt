 The COMPANY database: keeps track of employees, 
departments, and projects.

 The company is organized into DEPARTMENTs. Each 
department has a unique name, a unique number, and 
a particular employee who manages the department. 
We keep track of the start date when that employee 
began managing the department. A department may 
have several locations.

 A department controls a number of PROJECTs, each of 
which has a unique name, a unique number, and a 
single location.


 We store EMPLOYEE’s name, Social Security number, 
address, salary, sex, and birth date. An employee is 
assigned to one department, but may work on several 
projects, which are not necessarily controlled by the 
same department. We keep track of the current 
number of hours per week that an employee works on 
each project. We also keep track of the direct 
supervisor of each employee.

 We want to keep track of the DEPENDENTs of each 
employee, including first name, sex, birth date, and 
relationship to the employee.
